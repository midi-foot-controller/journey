# midi-foot-controller

This repository contains the accompaigning code to [www.midi-foot-controller.de](www.midi-foot-controller.de).
Over the next couple of month I'l try to develop a more or less professional midi foot controller using tools like:
- c++ / INO / JAVA
- compiler / disassembler
- AVR basics / tips and tricks
- Tools like graphviz, OpenSCAD, QCad-Pro, Virtual Source Code, PlatformIO, Intellij
- issues like c++ templates, classes
- and much more...
